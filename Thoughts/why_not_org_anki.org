* I tried, I really did, it's much easier to use and more intuitive feeling
* However, you run into the issue of opening up a note few months later on and asking if you used Org-Anki or [[id:3c0d052c-09b1-45da-b549-cdc191438895][Anki-Editor]]?
* Anki-Editor has better media support at end of the day, which is a dealbreaker
* Basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy][KISS]]
* DO NOT REPEAT THIS MISTAKE, AND JUST USE [[id:3c0d052c-09b1-45da-b549-cdc191438895][Anki-Editor]]
